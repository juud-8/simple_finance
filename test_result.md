All 9 core backend functionalities are working properly: health check, categories retrieval, expense CRUD operations, summary endpoints (daily/weekly/monthly), data validation, and error handling. The backend is using proper UUID generation, MongoDB integration, and FastAPI response models. All endpoints return proper JSON responses and handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes."

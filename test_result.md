# Personal Finance Tracker - Test Results

## Original User Problem Statement
User wanted to create a simple personal finance tracking app for iOS and Android with:
- Core functionality to display user's spending for current day, week, and month
- Clean UI focused on those three key figures
- Manual input for expenses with categorization
- Secure local data storage

## Project Summary
Created a **mobile-optimized Progressive Web App** using React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. The app provides:

- PWA capabilities for native-like experience
- Real-time expense tracking with day/week/month summaries
- Category-based expense management
- Smooth animations and modern UI design

## Testing Protocol
- MUST READ and UPDATE this file before invoking testing agents
- Test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- ASK USER before testing frontend with `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- NEVER edit the Testing Protocol section
- Follow minimum steps when editing this file
- Take user feedback seriously and implement changes accordingly

## Backend Testing Results ✅

### Key Backend Features:
- MongoDB integration working correctly

- Proper data validation and error handling
- Aggregation pipelines for summaries working
- Default categories pre-populated
- All endpoints return proper JSON responses

## Frontend Implementation Status ✅

## Next Steps for User
The core Personal Finance Tracker is now fully functional with:

- Any bugs or issues can be addressed quickly

## API Contracts for Frontend
All API endpoints use `/api` prefix and return JSON:
- POST /api/expenses - Create expense
- GET /api/expenses - Get expenses list
- GET /api/expenses/summary/{period} - Get summaries
- GET /api/categories - Get categories
- DELETE /api/expenses/{id} - Delete expense

Ready for frontend testing if user requests it.
